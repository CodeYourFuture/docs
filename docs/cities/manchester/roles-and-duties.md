title: Roles & Duties
---

Under the main trinity of [Volunteer teams](volunteers/teams.md),namely Outreach, Education & Personal Development,
generally, we need to act and fulfill different roles in order to run the course smoothly and effectively.
These roles also help to keep each member being engaged and organised.

A volunteer can wear different hats depending on the schedule, agenda, or in special circumstances.
All roles and tasks are optional, and no one is forced, or coerced into to doing things that they do not feel comfortable with.

Any help is welcomed :)
