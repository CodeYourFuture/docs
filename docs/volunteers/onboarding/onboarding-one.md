title: 1. Hello! Welcome to your first general tasks
---

Once you have attended your first onboarding session, you should receive an invitation to a training session, and after that, an invitation to a Slack workspace for new volunteers (also where new Applicants are). 

If you don't receive an invitation to Slack within 48 hours of your training session, please email us at contact@codeyourfuture.io. 

During your first training session, you will learn about the first volunteering tasks at CodeYourFuture. 

### Your first general tasks at CodeYourFuture: 

**1. Support the Intro to Coding programs (you can learn more about this in the training session)** 

**2. Call new students OR reviewing ITC module steps (if you know how to code)**

**3. Sign the CYF Volunteer Agreement**

Once you have completed these tasks - consider yourself awesome - and an inducted volunteer of CodeYourFuture. 

Let us know you have completed the tasks in Slack. We will invite you to have a chat with a local city organiser, and you are onto your next stage of volunteering!
